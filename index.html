Abstract:
Objective:
To characterize the pressure-volume (P-V) behavior of two common endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs across three airway models of increasing anatomic realism: rigid, elastic, and cadaveric, and to quantify the narrow volume threshold separating safe from potentially injurious cuff pressures.
Methods:
We tested TaperGuard™ and Sheridan™ reinforced ETTs (sizes 6.0-8.0 mm) in rigid manikin, elastic synthetic, and cadaveric tracheas. Cuff pressure was recorded after 0.2 mL incremental inflation up to 120 cmH₂O. Polynomial and power-law models were fitted to the P-V curves. Key metrics included ΔV from 20 to 30 cmH₂O, curve slope, and model fit accuracy.
Results:
All cuffs demonstrated nonlinear P-V behavior. Cadaveric tracheas exhibited the steepest pressure escalation, with ΔV (20→30 cmH₂O) as small as 0.25 mL. Elastic models showed delayed pressure rise, while rigid models escalated rapidly once wall contact was reached. Polynomial models (R² ≥ 0.93-0.99) better captured high-pressure transitions than power-law fits. Tapered cuffs achieved effective seals with lower volumes than cylindrical cuffs but demonstrated similarly steep pressure increases when overinflated.
Conclusion:
ETT cuff behavior is highly sensitive to airway compliance. Cadaveric airways showed a narrower inflation margin than synthetic models, underscoring the limitations of manikin-based training. Across designs, small additional volumes can precipitate unsafe pressures, highlighting the need for precise pressure-guided cuff management over volume estimation.

Introduction
Cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) are ubiquitous in airway management for anesthesia and critical care, serving the dual purpose of securing ventilation and protecting the lungs from aspiration of oropharyngeal contents.  Optimal management of endotracheal tube cuffs requires balancing pressures that must be high enough to prevent air leaks and dangerous aspiration of secretions, but not so high as to cause tissue damage. If cuff pressure exceeds the perfusion pressure of the tracheal mucosa, ischemic injury can occur, potentially leading to ulceration, cartilage damage, and long-term complications like tracheal stenosis1. If too low, it may allow aspiration of secretions or blood around the cuff, a major pathway for ventilator associated pneumonia and respiratory compromise in intubated patients2,3.
The recommended safe range for ETT cuff pressures (20-30 cm H2O) has been established from clinical and experimental observations showing pressures above 30 cm H2O showed visible blanching of the tracheal mucosa suggesting capillary compromise and those below 20 showed concerns for aspiration of secretions around the ETT cuff4,5. Researchers have proposed various inflation strategies, from minimal occlusive volume to continuous cuff pressure monitoring, to mitigate the risks of over‐ or under‐inflation2,6–8. Microaspiration can occur even with “proper” cuff pressures if there are folds or channels in the cuff, or if the pressure is insufficient to overcome factors like positive airway pressure or changes in patient position9–11.  To mitigate aspiration, manufacturers have introduced modifications such as tapered cuff shapes (which aim to reduce cuff folds and create a more continuous seal) and novel cuff materials like ultrathin polyurethane (which conforms more closely to the tracheal wall than traditional thicker PVC cuffs) 12–15.
Despite these advances, direct comparisons of ETT cuff performance between different tube brands and in airways with different compliance, such as rigid airway simulators, elastic models, and cadaveric tissue, remain limited. Previous work has demonstrated that tracheal anatomy can significantly affect intracuff pressure, because cuff shape, thickness, and resting diameter all interact with the airway’s compliance and geometry16,17.  However, few studies have simultaneously examined multiple ETT designs across varied airway conditions to characterize how quickly pressures may escalate. Such data are critical for clinicians who must decide which tube and inflation strategy to use under different circumstances, particularly when clinical resources for advanced monitoring (e.g., specialized cuff manometers or continuous volume‐time curves) may be limited18.
To better understand these dynamics, the present study systematically compared ETT cuff pressure-volume (P-V) behavior using three different tracheal models of increasing realism: a rigid pipe, an elastic simulated trachea model, and a cadaveric human trachea. By examining how ach model responds to incremental cuff inflation, we aimed to delineate the nonlinear P-V characteristics of ETT cuffs and the impact of airway compliance. This knowledge is crucial for improving cuff management strategies and preventing complications due to the narrow volume range between adequate sealing and overinflation.

Methods

We evaluated the P-V behavior of  ETT cuffs across three airway models:
•	Rigid manikin airway (Ambu™) simulating a noncompliant trachea
•	Elastic airway trainer (TruCorp™) representing compliant, tissue-like expansion
•	Cadaveric human tracheas (freshly frozen without fixatives) representing true human airway compliance
Two common adult ETT cuff types were tested in each model:
•	TaperGuard™ (Covidien) - a tapered high-volume, low-pressure cuff
•	Sheridan™ Reinforced (Teleflex) - a cylindrical high-volume, low-pressure cuff
Each tube was tested with internal diameters ranging from 6.0 to 8.0 mm. Cuffs were incrementally inflated using a Luer-lock syringe (max volume 10mL) in 0.2 mL steps, with intracuff pressure recorded after each injection using a calibrated cuff manometer. Inflation continued until 120 cmH₂O was reached. Each tube-model combination was tested in triplicate. Third-order polynomial models were fitted to the P-V data using least-squares regression: 
P(V) = a + bV + cV2 + dV3
If the cubic coefficient (d) was not statistically significant (p>0.05), the model was reduced to a second order (quadratic) polynomial:
P(V) =  a  + bV  + cV2.
Additionally, power-law relationships of the form:
P(V)=αVβ
were compared by log-transforming both variables and applying linear regression:
ln(P)=ln(α)+βln(V).
Model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and the standard error of the estimate (SEE). Pressure escalation slopes from 20 to 30 cmH₂O (i.e., ΔP/ΔV) were calculated, and inter-model differences in these slopes were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey posthoc comparisons. Paired t-tests were employed to compare residuals (polynomial vs. power-law) in the high-pressure region (V≥3.0 mL). All statistical tests were conducted in SPSS v28, with significance defined as p<0.05.
This study did not involve live human or animal subjects. Ethical considerations for cadaver use followed the relevant institutional guidelines (CORID #1091).

Results 
Nonlinear Pressure-Volume Behavior Across Models
All three airway models—rigid manikin, elastic trainer, and cadaveric trachea—demonstrated nonlinear pressure-volume (P-V) behavior across cuff types and sizes. Cuff pressure remained low in early inflation phases but escalated sharply beyond a specific threshold volume. Third-order polynomial models consistently produced a superior fit for this behavior, particularly in the high-pressure range (R² ≥ 0.93-0.99), outperforming power-law models, which underestimated pressures by 5-15 cmH₂O when inflation exceeded 3.0-3.5 mL.
Rigid Model
In the rigid manikin model, pressure escalation occurred at inflation volumes of 2.0-2.5 mL across both TaperGuard and Sheridan cuffs. Polynomial fits achieved R² values of 0.98-0.99 with standard errors of estimate (SEE) <2.0 cmH₂O. For instance, a representative TaperGuard 6.0 cuff fit was:
P(V)=3.50−15.33V+25.32V2−3.25V3(R2=0.98, SEE=1.87 cmH2O)
whereas the power-law approximation (ln(P)=16.18+1.42ln(V)) began to underestimate pressures by several cmH₂O at volumes greater than 3.0 mL, seen in Table 1. The volume increment (ΔV) required to transition from 20 cmH₂O to 30 cmH₂O ranged widely (0.22-0.70 mL), showing how quickly hazards of overinflation can develop in a noncompliant airway setting. Power-law approximations became increasingly inaccurate beyond 3.0 mL, underestimating pressure by 3-5 cmH₂O.
Elastic Trucorp Model
In the Trucorp elastic model, greater airway compliance allowed delayed pressure inflection. Compared to the rigid model, the inflation volume needed to reach 20 cmH₂O was 15-30% higher. However, once that threshold was surpassed, pressure still rose steeply into the 30 cmH₂O range within 0.3-0.4 mL. A representative polynomial fit (Sheridan 7.0 cuff) showed:
P(V)=−0.13+5.08V−2.24V2+0.41V3(R2=0.98, SEE=0.45 cmH2O).
while power-law functions (P=3.18V1.19) systematically under-predicted the final high-pressure phase by 5-10 cmH₂O if volumes exceeded roughly 4.5 mL (Table 2). Mean ΔV from 20 to 30 cmH₂O for both cuff types was 0.40 mL.
Cadaver Tissue
The cadaver trachea exhibited the earliest and steepest pressure escalation. Inflation volumes of just 2.5-3.0 mL resulted in pressures exceeding 20 cmH₂O, with only 0.2-0.3 mL additional air required to reach 30 cmH₂O. This ΔV was 50% smaller than in synthetic models (p < 0.01), indicating a significantly narrower "safe" inflation margin. For a TaperGuard 6.0 cuff:
P(V)=−0.64+25.45V+14.66V2−2.77V3(R2=0.997, SEE=0.17 cmH2O)
In contrast, a power-law approximation (P=e34.39V1.48) reproduced only the initial, lower-pressure range and erred by as much as 10-15 cmH₂O when volumes approached the 3.0-3.5 mL region, example in Table 3. Pressure escalation slopes in cadaveric tissue were 15-18% steeper than synthetic models (p < 0.01), suggesting heightened risk for mucosal injury in less compliant human tissue.
Cuff Design and Size Effects
Cross-model analysis for 7.0 mm cuffs demonstrated the following ΔV (20→30 cmH₂O):
•	Rigid model: 0.46 mL (TaperGuard), 0.50 mL (Sheridan)
•	Elastic model: 0.40 mL (both cuffs)
•	Cadaver model: 0.25 mL (TaperGuard), 0.30 mL (Sheridan)
Escalation slopes (cmH₂O/mL) were sharpest in cadaveric tissue: 40.0 (TaperGuard) vs. 33.3 (Sheridan), compared to 20-25 in synthetic models, summarized in the cross-model comparison (Table 4). Notably, the cadaver model had significantly smaller standard errors of estimate and showed a marked inflection in P-V curves within narrow volume thresholds.
TaperGuard cuffs required slightly lower volumes to achieve 20-30 cmH₂O compared to Sheridan cuffs, particularly in smaller tube sizes. At lower pressures, cuff geometry influenced inflation behavior: TaperGuard curves had smaller quadratic/cubic terms, indicating flatter slopes in early inflation phases. However, once pressure exceeded ~25 cmH₂O, both cuffs showed converging escalation behavior. Figures 3 and 4 show cross model comparisons of 6.0 and 8.0 size tubes.
Tube size influenced the absolute volume required to seal: 8.0 mm tubes needed 0.3-0.5 mL more than 6.0 mm tubes to reach 20 cmH₂O. However, this effect diminished at higher pressures, with similar ΔV and slope characteristics beyond 25 cmH₂O across sizes (p > 0.10). Among all sizes and models, the narrowest ΔV occurred in cadaveric models, independent of tube diameter. Full dataset-level fits and regression coefficients are provided in Supplementary Table 5. 

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that ETT cuff pressure-volume dynamics can vary dramatically depending on both the cuff design and the compliance of the surrounding tracheal environment. In the cadaveric trachea model, which most closely approximates the human airway, we observed a particularly steep pressure rise as the cuff approached its sealing volume. Notably, an increase of just ~0.25 mL of air near the sealing point caused cuff pressure to climb sharply into the high-pressure range. This underscores how limited the “safe zone” of inflation can be in a realistic airway: once the cuff fills the available tracheal space, even a tiny additional volume can send pressures past 30 cmH₂O. 
Our study demonstrates low-pressure plateau followed by high pressure spikes in all scenarios. This dual behavior is expected as it aligns with balloon mechanics where the uninflated, or underinflated cuff is easy to inflate when it is not constrained, however when it pushes against the solid boundary (the trachea), it requires increasingly high pressures to inflate. This transition occurred around 25-30 cmH₂O, suggesting that the cuff pressure safety range of 30 cmH₂O is not just related to tissue ischemia, but the mechanical tipping point where the trachea experiences a disproportionate increate in force for each added volume.  This finding is consistent with prior observations that ETT cuffs are highly sensitive to small volume increments, particularly in stiffer or smaller airway conduits, leading to disproportionately large pressure changes above our mechanical tipping point15,16. This underscores the importance of measuring cuff pressure whenever feasible, rather than relying solely on pilot‐balloon palpation or default inflation volumes3,19. In contrast, the elastic trachea model (with greater wall compliance) allowed a slightly larger volume window before a similarly dramatic pressure escalation occurred, whereas the rigid tube model (with no ability to expand) tended to reach high pressures abruptly as soon as the cuff contacted the wall. The key insight is that tracheal compliance significantly influences the pressure-volume (P-V) curve: less compliant airways yield much steeper P-V slopes and thus require especially careful inflation to avoid overshooting safe pressures.
Cuff design also played a pivotal role in cuff performance. Tapered cuffs achieved an effective seal at lower inflation volumes compared to conventional cylindrical cuffs, reaching the target safe pressure (~20-25 cmH₂O) with less air. Clinically, this suggests that tapered high-volume cuffs conform to the tracheal wall more efficiently, needing less inflation to obturate the airway. Such behavior can be beneficial in that it reduces the initial volume (and pressure) required for an adequate seal, potentially lowering the risk of unnecessary overinflation. Our results are consistent with prior reports that tapered cuff tubes can form a seal at lower cuff pressures than cylindrical designs.20 However, “less volume to seal” does not eliminate the risk of injury from overinflation, it simply shifts the pressure-volume curve. In our tests, if a tapered cuff was inflated beyond the minimal sealing volume, its pressure still rose quickly and could exceed safe thresholds, though the critical volume at which this occurred was smaller. This finding reinforces that regardless of cuff shape and varying cuff size, even when the internal tube diameter is identical, vigilant monitoring of cuff pressure is required rather than relying solely on pilot‐balloon palpation or default inflation volumes32129. A tapered cuff may provide a modest safety buffer; for example, a better seal at lower baseline pressure and smaller pressure changes with certain external stresses, but our results confirm that it too can generate excessive pressures if overinflated or if the tracheal wall cannot accommodate further expansion20,27,28. 
Another notable aspect of this study is the mathematical characterization of the cuff’s pressure-volume behavior. We found that a third-order polynomial function provided a superior fit for the high-pressure segment of the P-V curve compared to a simple power-law model. In practical terms, this means the relationship between added volume and resulting pressure is not a fixed exponential ratio but rather has a more complex curvature, particularly as the cuff becomes tightly constrained by the tracheal wall. The polynomial model captured the abrupt upswing in pressure that occurs as the cuff approaches the limits of the tracheal space, whereas the power-law model tended to underestimate these late-phase pressure surges. This insight supports the concept that cuff inflation dynamics involve multiple phases - an initial compliant phase followed by a sharply rising phase once the cuff and trachea walls are in close apposition. It also explains why small volume increments can be benign early in inflation but hazardous later on.22 Standard in vitro testing or modeling that assumes a simple volume-pressure relationship may fail to predict these dangerous spikes, underscoring the need for cautious, stepwise inflation and continuous pressure monitoring in practice23. By appreciating the nonlinear and compliance-dependent nature of ETT cuff dynamics demonstrated in this study, practitioners and researchers can better tailor cuff inflation practices to maintain airway security while minimizing the risk of mucosal damage.
From a clinical perspective, our results underline several important points for airway management. Pressures exceeding 30 cmH₂O can rapidly compromise tracheal mucosal blood flow and have been linked to tissue damage when sustained4. Our data illustrate how easily such high pressures may be reached if cuff volume is not carefully titrated, reinforcing the importance of using the minimum effective cuff volume (or pressure) to achieve a seal and of keeping cuff pressures below ~30 cmH₂O21. Across the three airway models, rigid, elastic, and cadaveric, the margin between a “safe” 20 cmH₂O and 30 cmH₂O could be as small as 0.2-0.3 mL of added air. Because syringes or manual estimates often exceed such small increments, there is a real risk of inadvertently applying unsafe pressures17,24.  In practice, this means routine use of cuff pressure manometers and adherence to minimal occlusive volume techniques, since “just a bit more air” in an already inflated cuff can inadvertently cause a dramatic pressure rise. Additionally, the pronounced influence of tracheal compliance suggests that individual patient factors (such as tracheal stiffness or external compression by neck surgical retractors) will significantly affect cuff pressures. An inflation that results in 20 cmH₂O in one patient might produce far higher pressure in another with a stiffer airway or narrower tracheal diameter, even for the same added volume of air13. Bench tests using rigid airway models likely underestimate these patient-specific differences, so clinicians should be especially vigilant and consider continuous pressure monitoring in situations of reduced or altered airway compliance, even if initial cuff pressures appear acceptable14,23,25. Moreover, simulation-based airway models, while useful for training, often lack the fidelity to predict real-world pressure-volume dynamics, particularly in edge cases23,25,26.
There are limitations to this study. First, though the cadaveric trachea more closely approximates actual tissue anatomy and stiffness than do synthetic models, it cannot replicate living physiology such as mucosal blood flow or reactive edema30. Second, we did not track changes in cuff pressure or tracheal compliance over time. Gradual tracheal dilation in cadavers or evolving edema in living tissue could alter compliance, but these dynamics were not captured here.  Third, we did not evaluate long‐term effects of sustained cuff pressures on tissue integrity; future studies could investigate extended inflation and perfusion in ex vivo or in vivo designs. Despite these limitations, the trends observed provide valuable guidance for clinicians about how cuff design and patient anatomy interact. Additional research might focus on real‐time cuff monitoring during patient maneuvers, e.g., head rotation, sedation changes, or mechanical ventilation adjustments, that can inadvertently shift cuff volumes. Investigations into next‐generation cuffs (e.g., advanced materials or tapered shapes) may also clarify whether they mitigate the steep pressure jumps reported here, ultimately guiding safer design or recommended inflation strategies12.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that ETT cuff pressure-volume behavior is highly sensitive to both airway compliance and cuff design. In the cadaveric trachea, where compliance is lowest, cuff pressure escalated sharply with as little as 0.25 mL of added volume, leaving a narrow margin between sealing and overinflation. Tapered cuffs reached safe pressures with lower volumes than cylindrical cuffs, but all designs exhibited steep pressure increases beyond the sealing point. Polynomial models best captured these nonlinear dynamics. Clinically, these findings emphasize the importance of cuff pressure monitoring and caution against using fixed inflation volumes. Safe airway management requires an appreciation of how small volume adjustments can disproportionately affect cuff pressure, especially in less compliant airways.

2. AIMS AND SCOPE

The Laryngoscope has been the leading source of information on advances in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck disorders for over 120 years. The Laryngoscope is the first choice among otolaryngologists for publication of their important findings and techniques.

Each monthly issue of The Laryngoscope features peer-reviewed medical, clinical, and research contributions in general otolaryngology, allergy/rhinology, otology/neurotology, laryngology/broncho-esophagology, head and neck surgery, sleep medicine, pediatric otolaryngology, and facial plastics and reconstructive surgery. Contributions include papers and posters presented at the Annual and Section Meetings of the Triological Society, as well as independent papers, "How I Do It", "Triological Best Practice" articles, and systematic reviews.

Theses authored by the Triological Society’s new Fellows as well as papers presented at meetings of the American Laryngological Association and American Broncho-Esophagological Association are published in either The Laryngoscope or Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology.

The Laryngoscope is owned by the American Laryngological Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc. aka The Triological Society, and is the official journal of the Society, The American Laryngological Association, and the American Broncho-Esophagological Association. The Journal is published by Wiley.

Word limit: 3,000 words (max), excluding abstract and references
Abstract: Must be structured under the sub-headings: Objective(s), Methods, Results, Conclusion
References: 75 references (max)
Figures/Tables: Total of no more than 8 figures and tables
Description: Original reports should present data that have not yet been published

ii.       Systematic Reviews

Systematic Reviews present clinical topics supported by significant recent literature and data sources. The review should answer a specific, hypothesis - based, research question. The literature and data sources should be explored in a thorough and comprehensive manner, preferably with the assistance of a librarian or other professional trained in the proper search of the medical literature.

These systematic reviews should be focused and follow the standard format as delineated in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) document, or MOOSE (Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. The PRISMA document(s) can be found at http://www.prisma-statement.org/. Please note that there are extensions for Individual patient data (IPD) and Network meta-analyses (NMA) that may be applicable depending on the type of data available and the comparisons being made. The explanation for MOOSE can be found at: http://www.consort-statement.org/Media/Default/Downloads/Other%20Instruments/MOOSE%20Statement%202000.pdf.

Please note that there is a difference between a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review is the manuscript type that includes the methods of literature search, critical appraisal, and synthesis of data from multiple selected studies to answer a research question, which preferably includes meta-analyses of quantitative data. A meta-analysis is the statistical method only (which may or may not be applied depending on the availability of appropriate data); it is not a manuscript type.

In brief, Systematic Reviews should include the following:

    Description of the focused research question, using the PICOS (Participant, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study design) criteria
    Critical appraisal of prior reviews on the topic
    Explicit description of the electronic search strategy and databases used (at least 3), including Mesh titles, dates of inclusion, and the names of those performing the search
    Report of the results of the search, the studies screened, and the studies included
    Explicit description of selection criteria for inclusion in the final review
    State the primary outcome variable
    Report the statistical methods used for data analysis and synthesis
    Extract and report the key outcomes and findings from each study
    Synthesize the data into a summary analysis, including forest plots if a meta-analysis is performed, and an analysis of heterogeneity
    Perform a risk of bias analysis and discuss the risks of bias across studies. Please note that this is separate and distinct from the Levels of Evidence (https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/levels-of-evidence)
    Summarize the results of the data synthesis and analysis
    Provide an overall interpretation of the results, in the context of the published literature
    In order to confirm a submission contains all the required systematic review elements, authors must complete the following checklist. The completed checklist must then be uploaded with other manuscript files when completing submission.

Abstract (250 words) with the headings: Objective, Data Sources, Review Methods, Results, and Conclusion
Key Words

Discussion
Acknowledgment (grants and research report)
References

Word count: 4000 words maximum (Introduction through Conclusion)
Figures/Tables: No more than a total of 8 figures and tables. Must include a flow diagram and a table describing all included studies.

iii.      Scoping Reviews

Scoping Reviews present clinical or translational topics with emerging literature and data sources. They are a type of review that may be appropriate when there is insufficient data for a true systematic review. Scoping reviews do not address a specific, hypothesis – based research questions like systematic literature reviews do. The role of the scoping review is to identify gaps in knowledge, summarize the state of the current literature, clarify definitions/concepts, but not to make recommendations or conclusions that affect clinical care. A scoping review is not meant to serve as a shortened systematic review without data analysis.

We recommend reading the following publication for more information about scoping reviews before submitting: Munn Z, Peters MDJ, Stern C, Tufanaru C, McArthur A, Aromataris E. Systematic review or scoping review? Guidance for authors when choosing between a systematic or scoping review approach. BMC Medical Research Methodology (2018) 18:143. https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12874-018-0611-x.pdf

Offering expert help in English language editing, translation, manuscript formatting, and figure preparation, Wiley Editing Services ensures that the manuscript is ready for submission. Resource Identification Initiative

The journal supports the Resource Identification Initiative, which aims to promote research resource identification, discovery, and reuse. This initiative, led by the Neuroscience Information Framework and the Oregon Health & Science University Library, provides unique identifiers for antibodies, model organisms, cell lines, and tools including software and databases. These IDs, called Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs), are machine-readable and can be used to search for all papers where a particular resource was used and to increase access to critical data to help researchers identify suitable reagents and tools.

Authors are asked, when applicable, to use RRIDs to cite the resources used in their research where applicable in the text, similar to a regular citation or Genbank Accession number. For antibodies, authors should include in the citation the vendor, catalogue number, and RRID both in the text upon first mention in the Methods section. For software tools and databases, please provide the name of the resource followed by the resource website, if available, and the RRID. For model organisms, the RRID alone is sufficient.

Additionally, authors must include the RIIDs in the list of keywords associated with the manuscript.

To Obtain Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs):

    Use the Resource Identification Portal, created by the Resource Identification Initiative Working Group.
    Search for the research resource (please see the section titled “Search Features and Tips” for more information).
    Click on the “Cite This” button to obtain the citation and insert the citation into the manuscript text.

If there is a resource that is not found within the Portal, authors are asked to register the resource with the appropriate resource authority. Information on how to do this is provided in the “Resource Citation Guidelines” section of the Portal.

If any difficulties in obtaining identifiers arise, please contact rii-help@scicrunch.org for assistance.

6. EDITORIAL POLICIES AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Publication Policies and Procedures

All Editors, Editorial Board members, and publisher’s staff at The Laryngoscope ensure that the highest ethical publication standards are maintained by assisting in safeguarding the medical scientific literature against fraudulent publications.

All manuscripts are submitted for plagiarism detection through iThenticate. The Laryngoscope’s policy is based on the “Guidelines on Good Publication Practice” published by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).

Exclusive publication. The Laryngoscope reserves the right to exclusive publication of all accepted manuscripts. Examples of fraud in scientific research include (but are not limited to):

    Submission of duplicate publications using similar data (i.e., attesting the manuscript submitted is original when it was submitted or accepted by another journal)
    Falsification of data, copyright, or information regarding conflict of interest
    Submission of manuscript from other sources that was not done by the author and is presented as original (i.e., plagiarism)
    Authorship (allowing one’s name to appear as an author or adding an author to a manuscript) without substantial input or without having agreed to submission of the manuscript
    Self-plagiarism (duplicating previously published material);
    Undisclosed conflicts of interest

If there are questions as to any issues regarding publication policies/procedures, please see Wiley’s Best Practice Guidelines on Publishing Ethics: https://authorservices.wiley.com/ethics-guidelines/index.html.

Editorial Review and Acceptance

The acceptance criteria for all manuscripts are the quality and originality of the research and its significance to journal readership. Manuscripts will only be sent to review if the Editor-in-Chief determines that the manuscript meets the appropriate quality and relevance requirements.  All manuscripts  selected for peer review are subjected to single-blind review. Wiley's policy on confidentiality of the review process is available here.

At any time during the peer review process, including after the submission of a revised version, the article may be rejected. Decision related internal discussions between the editor in chief, associate editor and/or external reviewers is privileged.

Refer and Transfer Program 

Wiley believes that no valuable research should go unshared. This journal participates in Wiley’s Refer & Transfer program. If your manuscript is not accepted, you may receive a recommendation to transfer your manuscript to another suitable Wiley journal, either through a referral from the journal’s editor or through our Transfer Desk Assistant. 

Data Storage and Documentation

The Laryngoscope encourages data sharing wherever possible, unless this is prevented by ethical, privacy, or confidentiality matters. Authors publishing in the journal are therefore encouraged to make their data, scripts, and other artifacts used to generate the analyses presented in the manuscript available via a publicly available data repository; however, this is not mandatory.

If the study includes original data, at least one author must confirm that he or she had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Human Studies and Subjects

For manuscripts reporting medical studies that involve human participants, a statement identifying the ethics committee that approved the study and confirmation that the study conforms to recognized standards is required in the Methods Section, for example: Declaration of Helsinki; US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects; or European Medicines Agency Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

Images and information from individual participants will only be published where the authors have obtained the individual's free prior informed consent. Authors do not need to provide a copy of the consent form to the publisher; however, in signing the author license to publish, authors are required to confirm that consent has been obtained. Wiley has a standard patient consent form available for use.

Animal Studies

A statement indicating that the protocol and procedures employed were ethically reviewed and approved, as well as the name of the body giving approval, must be included in the Methods section of the manuscript. Authors are encouraged to adhere to animal research reporting standards, for example the ARRIVE reporting guidelines for reporting study design and statistical analysis; experimental procedures; experimental animals and housing and husbandry. Authors should also state whether experiments were performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals:

    US authors should cite compliance with the US National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the US Public Health Service's Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
    UK authors should conform to UK legislation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations (SI 2012/3039).
    European authors outside the UK should conform to Directive 2010/63/EU.

Clinical Trial Registration

The journal requires that clinical trials are prospectively registered in a publicly accessible database and clinical trial registration numbers should be included in all manuscripts that report their results. Authors are asked to include the name of the trial register and the clinical trial registration number at the end of the abstract. If the trial is not registered, or was registered retrospectively, the reasons for this should be explained.

Research Reporting Guidelines

Accurate and complete reporting enables readers to fully appraise research, replicate it, and use it. Authors are expected to adhere to the following research reporting standards.

    CONSORT guidelines for randomized trials
    PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Species Names

Upon its first use in the title, abstract, and text, the common name of a species should be followed by the scientific name (genus, species, and authority) in parenthesis. for well-known species, however, scientific names may be omitted from the article titles. If no common name exists in English, only the scientific name should be used.

Genetic Nomenclature

Sequence variants should be described in the text and tables using both DNA and protein designations whenever appropriate. Sequence variant nomenclature must follow the current HGVS guidelines; see varnomen.hgvs.org, where examples of acceptable nomenclature are provided.

Sequence Data

Nucleotide sequence data can be submitted in electronic form to any of the three major collaborative databases: DDBJ, EMBL, or GenBank. It is only necessary to submit to one database as data are exchanged between DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank on a daily basis. The suggested wording for referring to accession-number information is: ‘These sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession number U12345’. Addresses are as follows:

    DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp
    EMBL Nucleotide Archive: ebi.ac.uk/ena
    GenBank www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank

Proteins sequence data should be submitted to either of the following repositories.

    Protein Information Resource (PIR): pir.georgetown.edu
    SWISS-PROT: expasy.ch/sprot/sprot-top

Structural Data

For manuscripts describing structural data, atomic coordinates and the associated experimental data should be deposited in the appropriate databank (see below). Please note that the data in the databanks must be released, at the latest, upon publication of the article. We trust in the cooperation of our authors to ensure that atomic coordinates and experimental data are released on time.

    Organic and organometallic compounds: Crystallographic data should not be sent as Supporting Information, but should be deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) at ccdc.cam.ac.uk/services/structure_deposit.
    Inorganic compounds: Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe (FIZ; fiz-karlsruhe.de).
    Protens and nucleic acids: Protein Data Bank (rcsb.org/pdb).
    NMR spectroscopy data: BioMagResBank (bmrb.wisc.edu).

Conflict of Interest

The journal requires that all authors disclose any potential sources of conflict of interest. Any interest or relationship, financial or otherwise that might be perceived as influencing an author's objectivity is considered a potential source of conflict of interest. These must be disclosed when directly relevant or directly related to the work that the authors describe in their manuscript.

Potential sources of conflict of interest include, but are not limited to: patent or stock ownership, membership of a company board of directors, membership of an advisory board or committee for a company, and consultancy for or receipt of speaker's fees from a company. The existence of a conflict of interest does not preclude publication. If the authors have no conflict of interest to declare, they must also state this at submission. It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to review this policy with all authors and collectively to disclose with the submission ALL pertinent commercial and other relationships.

Funding

Authors should list all funding sources in the Acknowledgments section. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of their funder designation. If in doubt, please check the Open Funder Registry for the correct nomenclature: https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/

Authorship

All those listed as authors should qualify for authorship according to the following criteria in accordance with ICMJE standards:

1. Have made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data;
2. Been involved in drafting the manuscript or revising it critically for important intellectual content;
3. Given final approval of the version to be published. Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content; and
4. Agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Individuals that do not meet the authorship requirements may be listed in the Acknowledgement section as collaborators.

Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) tools—such as ChatGPT and others based on large language models (LLMs)—cannot be considered capable of initiating an original piece of research without direction by human authors. They also cannot be accountable for a published work or for research design, which is a generally held requirement of authorship (as discussed in the previous section), nor do they have legal standing or the ability to hold or assign copyright. Therefore—in accordance with COPE’s position statement on AI tools—these tools cannot fulfill the role of, nor be listed as, an author of an article. If an author has used this kind of tool to develop any portion of a manuscript, its use must be described, transparently and in detail, in the Methods or Acknowledgements section. The author is fully responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by the tool and for correctly referencing any supporting work on which that information depends. Tools that are used to improve spelling, grammar, and general editing are not included in the scope of these guidelines. The final decision about whether use of an AIGC tool is appropriate or permissible in the circumstances of a submitted manuscript or a published article lies with the journal’s editor or other party responsible for the publication’s editorial policy.

ORCID

As part of the journal's commitment to supporting authors at every step of the publishing process the journal requires the submitting author (only) to provide an ORCID iD when submitting a manuscript. This takes around 2 minutes to complete. Find more information here.

7. AUTHOR LICENSING

If a manuscript is accepted for publication, the author identified as the formal corresponding author will receive an email prompting him/her to log in to Author Services, where via the Wiley Author Licensing Service (WALS) he/she will be required to complete a copyright or license agreement on behalf of all authors of the manuscript.

2. Structured Abstract (≤250 words)

For original reports, The Laryngoscope requests a structured abstract with four headings:

    Objective (or “Objectives”)

    Methods

    Results

    Conclusion

Your current abstract mostly follows this format but ensure it uses these exact headings and that it does not exceed ~250 words. Move any references out of the abstract and into the main text.

Also, The Laryngoscope requires:

    Keywords: Provide 3–5 keywords after the abstract.

    Level of Evidence: e.g., “Level of Evidence: NA” (if purely bench research or ex vivo cadaver studies) or “Level of Evidence: 4” if it is retrospective or observational.

Example structured abstract snippet (condensed):

    Objective: To characterize the pressure-volume (P-V) behavior of two common endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs across three airway models (rigid, elastic, and cadaveric) and quantify the narrow volume threshold separating safe from injurious cuff pressures.
    Methods: TaperGuard™ and Sheridan™ reinforced ETTs (sizes 6.0–8.0 mm) were incrementally inflated in rigid manikin, elastic synthetic, and cadaveric tracheas. …
    Results: All cuffs showed nonlinear P-V curves. Cadaveric tracheas exhibited the steepest pressure escalation (ΔV as small as 0.25 mL between 20 and 30 cmH₂O). …
    Conclusion: ETT cuff pressures are extremely sensitive to airway compliance. In cadaveric airways, minimal volume changes can precipitate unsafe pressures, emphasizing the importance of direct cuff pressure monitoring.

    Keywords: endotracheal tube; cuff pressure; tracheal compliance; cadaveric model; airway management
    Level of Evidence: NA

3. Main Text Organization

For an Original Report, the journal asks for:

    Introduction

    Materials and Methods (or “Methods”)

    Results

    Discussion

    Conclusion

    References

Your current paper already has these sections (labeled slightly differently). Just rename or re-check for consistency with the guidelines:

    Rename “Methods” and “Results” headings exactly as above.

    Place the “Conclusion” as its own short, final heading.

4. References: AMA Style in Consecutive Numerical Order

    The Laryngoscope uses AMA style with superscript numerals in the text.

    Reference list is in the order of citation in the text (the first appearance of each reference in the text is reference #1, next is #2, etc.).

    Each reference entry typically follows this format (journal article example):

    Author(s). Article title. Journal Name. Year;Volume(Issue):Page–Page. doi:

    Make sure to remove references from the abstract itself.

    Ensure you do not exceed the recommended maximum of 75 references (yours are under 30, so that is fine).

Currently, your references are close to AMA style but check for:

    Journal abbreviations (e.g., Laryngoscope, J Int Med Res).

    Proper spacing, punctuation, italics.

    Superscript citations in the main text.

5. Tables and Figures

    Label each table Table 1, Table 2, etc., with a descriptive title above it and any legends/footnotes below.

    Legends for figures go below the figure, labeled Figure 1, Figure 2, etc., with a descriptive caption.

    Each figure should be referred to in the text by number in consecutive order.

    Note that The Laryngoscope counts multi-paneled figures as multiple. Ensure you stay within 8 total figures/tables recommended for an original article.

6. Word Count

For an Original Report:

    Limit is ~3,000 words (Introduction through Conclusion), excluding abstract and references.

    Double-check your total main-text word count. If you exceed 3,000, consider condensing.

7. Ethical Statements

If your study used cadaveric specimens, typically you should include a brief statement in Materials and Methods clarifying the IRB or institutional guidelines for cadaveric use, e.g.:

    “This study did not involve live human or animal subjects. Ethical considerations for cadaver use followed the relevant institutional guidelines (approval #, if applicable).”

8. Conflicts of Interest / Funding

    Ensure you have a Conflict of Interest statement in the Title Page or in a footnote.

    Clearly list all research grants or “None.”

Summary of What to Fix

    Create a proper Title Page with title, running title, authors, affiliations, conflict-of-interest statement, and corresponding-author info.

    Use a structured abstract (Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusion), ≤250 words, followed by 3–5 Keywords and a Level of Evidence statement.

    Organize main text into Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.

    Use AMA reference style with superscript in-text citations in consecutive numeric order and a matching reference list.

    Ensure table/figure limits (≤8 combined for an original article), label them clearly, and refer to them in order.

    Check word count ~3,000 max for the main text.

    Insert a short statement regarding IRB/ethical compliance for cadaveric samples.

    Provide Conflicts of Interest/Funding statements.

Following these steps will align your manuscript with The Laryngoscope’s main requirements for an Original Report. Once revised accordingly, you should be ready to submit via Wiley’s Research Exchange submission portal. Good luck!

Editor-in-Chief, The Laryngoscope
[Name of Editor-in-Chief, if known]
c/o Wiley’s Research Exchange Submission Portal

Dear Dr. [Editor’s Last Name] / Dear Editor:

I am pleased to submit our manuscript, "Experimental Characterization of Endotracheal Tube Cuff Pressure-Volume Behavior in Simulated and Cadaveric Tracheas: A Comparative Study of Rigid, Elastic, and Cadaveric Airway Models," for consideration in The Laryngoscope.

Significance and Purpose of the Study
In this work, we characterized the pressure–volume (P-V) behavior of two common endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs within three different tracheal models (rigid, elastic, and cadaveric). The primary aim was to highlight how variations in airway compliance can dramatically impact ETT cuff pressures and create a narrow safe zone for inflation. These data underscore the importance of direct cuff-pressure measurement in preventing both insufficient seal and dangerous overinflation.

What the Study Adds
This study brings novel insights into how real human (cadaveric) tissue differs significantly from commonly used manikin or elastic synthetic models. Given the potential for airway injury from elevated cuff pressures, these findings reinforce the clinical relevance of monitoring cuff pressures closely and the limitations of relying on manikin-based training alone. We believe this information will be valuable to anesthesiologists, otolaryngologists, and critical care specialists.

Originality Statement
We confirm that this work is original, has not been published previously (except as an abstract), and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. All authors have approved the manuscript, agreed to its submission, and take responsibility for its content.

Compliance with Ethical Guidelines
This study did not involve live human or animal subjects. Ethical considerations for cadaveric use followed the relevant institutional policies and approval. We declare that the authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose, and the study did not receive external funding [if true—otherwise specify any funding sources].

Why The Laryngoscope?
The Laryngoscope is a premier journal for important clinical, academic, and research findings in otolaryngology, head and neck surgery, and related disciplines. We believe our manuscript offers clinically actionable insights into ETT cuff management and highlights areas where standard training methods may be improved. As such, it would be well aligned with the journal’s readership and mission.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this manuscript. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. [Editor’s Last Name] / Dear Editor:

I am pleased to submit our manuscript, “Experimental Characterization of Endotracheal Tube Cuff Pressure-Volume Behavior in Simulated and Cadaveric Tracheas: A Comparative Study of Rigid, Elastic, and Cadaveric Airway Models,” for your consideration in The Laryngoscope.

Why This Study Matters
Airway management often hinges on balancing endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressures to ensure adequate ventilation while minimizing mucosal injury. Yet, most training and clinical practice rely on manikin-based simulations that rarely approximate the compliance of actual human tissue. Our team sought to bridge that gap by systematically comparing P–V behavior across rigid, elastic, and cadaveric models.

Key Insights
We found that cadaveric tracheas exhibit a notably steeper pressure escalation than either the manikin or synthetic model, often requiring just a fraction of a milliliter of additional volume to push cuff pressures into the unsafe range (>30 cmH₂O). These findings highlight that even the most advanced elastic models may oversimplify real-world airway conditions, underscoring the critical need to monitor cuff pressures directly rather than relying solely on manikin-based training or “pilot-balloon feel.”

Relevance to The Laryngoscope
The readership of The Laryngoscope spans practicing otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, and critical care specialists—all of whom regularly handle airways in high-stakes environments. We believe our data offer pragmatic guidance on ETT selection and inflation strategies, emphasize potential pitfalls in routine cuff management, and suggest ways to refine educational curricula for airway simulation.

Originality and Disclosure
This work is original, has not been submitted elsewhere, and all authors have approved the manuscript. We have no conflicts of interest and received no external funding for this research.

We appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to the possibility of sharing our study with the journal’s community. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or requests for additional information.

Sincerely,

Below is a suggested approach to creating and describing a supplemental information website for your article. It includes both (a) the content and organizational plan for the website itself, and (b) a short statement you can place within your main manuscript to direct readers to the supplemental site. Feel free to adapt it to your specific needs and hosting platform.
1. Website Organizational Plan

A. Landing Page (“Overview”)

    Short introduction:

        One or two concise paragraphs that summarize what additional information is available.

        State how it relates to the main article.

    Link to Citation:

        Include the article title, authors, and a direct link to the article on the journal’s website.

        If applicable, note any relevant DOIs (article DOI, data repository DOIs, etc.).

B. Methods Section Enhancement
Include high-resolution photos or a short video of your methodology that would be too lengthy or too detailed for the article itself. Consider grouping them by subheadings. For example:

    Trachea Preparation (cadaveric, elastic, or rigid model)

    Instrument Setup (cuff manometer, syringes, data acquisition)

    Inflation Protocol (stepwise demonstration of the increments in real time)

Each subheading can contain:

    Photo gallery or short embedded video.

    Short descriptive captions (1–3 sentences each) clarifying what the user is looking at, or pointing out key details.

C. Full Data Tables / Raw Data Files

    Detailed Pressure-Volume Data: Provide CSV or Excel files for each trial if permissible.

    Statistical Output: Upload any extended regression output, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals, etc.

    Code or Scripts (if relevant): If you used R, Python, or another program for data analysis, share the script so others can replicate the analysis.

D. Additional Figures or Graphs

    High-resolution versions of your P–V curves, annotated to highlight important features.

    Any color-coded or 3D schematics that might not fit in the print or PDF version.

E. FAQ or Common Questions

    An optional section addressing typical clarifications or concerns (e.g., “How were the cadaveric specimens prepared?” or “Why were certain tubes chosen?”).

2. Sample Text to Include in the Manuscript

You can insert a brief note (usually in the Methods, Discussion, or “Supplemental Materials” section) directing readers to your website for additional data. Below is an example:

Supplemental Information Website

    Detailed images of the experimental setup, additional raw data tables, and high-resolution figures are available on our supplemental information website: http://www.[YourSite].org/ETT-Supplement.

    On this site, readers will find:

        High-resolution photographs and schematics illustrating the cadaveric, elastic, and rigid airway models.

        Complete numeric datasets (CSV format) for each pressure–volume trial, including intermediate steps and triplicate measurements.

        Extended statistical analysis output, polynomial regression coefficients, and goodness-of-fit tables.

        Additional commentary and media (e.g., short video clips) demonstrating the incremental cuff inflation process.

(Note: The URL above is fictional—replace it with your actual link.)
3. Tips for a User-Friendly Supplemental Website

    Clear Navigation: Use a simple menu or table of contents so visitors can easily jump to “Methods Photos,” “Raw Data,” “Extended Stats,” etc.

    Descriptive Filenames: If you offer file downloads, name them systematically (e.g., “CadavericModel_Trial1.csv,” “ElasticTrachea_PhotoSet.zip”) so they’re easy to identify.

    Permalinks: Where possible, ensure each section (photos, data, etc.) has a stable URL so that references or bookmarks will not break.

    Acknowledgments & Credits: If you had collaborators who helped create the supplemental data (lab techs, photographers, etc.), credit them here.

    Compliance Statement: If there are any IRB, institutional, or patient privacy considerations, reiterate them on the website.

4. Optional: Highlighting Interactive Elements

If you plan to make the site more interactive—for example, embedded dynamic graphs or a “click-to-view” 3D model—be sure to provide short instructions or tooltips so visitors can engage with these elements.
Summary

By combining the main paper with a well-organized supplemental website, you can showcase complete data and visually document the nuances of your methods. That transparency not only strengthens the impact of your publication but also encourages reproducibility and educational value for others in the field.

Abstract:
Objective:
To characterize the pressure-volume (P-V) behavior of two common endotracheal tube (ETT) cuffs across three airway models of increasing anatomic realism: rigid, elastic, and cadaveric, and to quantify the narrow volume threshold separating safe from potentially injurious cuff pressures.
Methods:
We tested TaperGuard™ and Sheridan™ reinforced ETTs (sizes 6.0-8.0 mm) in rigid manikin, elastic synthetic, and cadaveric tracheas. Cuff pressure was recorded after 0.2 mL incremental inflation up to 120 cmH₂O. Polynomial and power-law models were fitted to the P-V curves. Key metrics included ΔV from 20 to 30 cmH₂O, curve slope, and model fit accuracy.
Results:
All cuffs demonstrated nonlinear P-V behavior. Cadaveric tracheas exhibited the steepest pressure escalation, with ΔV (20→30 cmH₂O) as small as 0.25 mL. Elastic models showed delayed pressure rise, while rigid models escalated rapidly once wall contact was reached. Polynomial models (R² ≥ 0.93-0.99) better captured high-pressure transitions than power-law fits. Tapered cuffs achieved effective seals with lower volumes than cylindrical cuffs but demonstrated similarly steep pressure increases when overinflated.
Conclusion:
ETT cuff behavior is highly sensitive to airway compliance. Cadaveric airways showed a narrower inflation margin than synthetic models, underscoring the limitations of manikin-based training. Across designs, small additional volumes can precipitate unsafe pressures, highlighting the need for precise pressure-guided cuff management over volume estimation.

 

Introduction
Cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) are ubiquitous in airway management for anesthesia and critical care, serving the dual purpose of securing ventilation and protecting the lungs from aspiration of oropharyngeal contents.  Optimal management of endotracheal tube cuffs requires balancing pressures that must be high enough to prevent air leaks and dangerous aspiration of secretions, but not so high as to cause tissue damage. If cuff pressure exceeds the perfusion pressure of the tracheal mucosa, ischemic injury can occur, potentially leading to ulceration, cartilage damage, and long-term complications like tracheal stenosis1. If too low, it may allow aspiration of secretions or blood around the cuff, a major pathway for ventilator associated pneumonia and respiratory compromise in intubated patients2,3.
The recommended safe range for ETT cuff pressures (20-30 cm H2O) has been established from clinical and experimental observations showing pressures above 30 cm H2O showed visible blanching of the tracheal mucosa suggesting capillary compromise and those below 20 showed concerns for aspiration of secretions around the ETT cuff4,5. Researchers have proposed various inflation strategies, from minimal occlusive volume to continuous cuff pressure monitoring, to mitigate the risks of over or under inflation2,6–8. Microaspiration can occur even with “proper” cuff pressures if there are folds or channels in the cuff, or if the pressure is insufficient to overcome factors like positive airway pressure or changes in patient position9–11.  To mitigate aspiration, manufacturers have introduced modifications such as tapered cuff shapes (which aim to reduce cuff folds and create a more continuous seal) and novel cuff materials like ultrathin polyurethane (which conforms more closely to the tracheal wall than traditional thicker PVC cuffs) 12–15.
Despite these advances, direct comparisons of ETT cuff performance between different tube brands and in airways with different compliance, such as rigid airway simulators, elastic models, and cadaveric tissue, remain limited. Previous work has demonstrated that tracheal anatomy can significantly affect intracuff pressure, because cuff shape, thickness, and resting diameter all interact with the airway’s compliance and geometry16,17.  However, few studies have simultaneously examined multiple ETT designs across varied airway conditions to characterize how quickly pressures may escalate. Such data are critical for clinicians who must decide which tube and inflation strategy to use under different circumstances, particularly when clinical resources for advanced monitoring (e.g., specialized cuff manometers or continuous volume‐time curves) may be limited18.
To better understand these dynamics, the present study systematically compared ETT cuff pressure-volume (P-V) behavior using three different tracheal models of increasing realism: a rigid pipe, an elastic simulated trachea model, and a cadaveric human trachea. By examining how ach model responds to incremental cuff inflation, we aimed to delineate the nonlinear P-V characteristics of ETT cuffs and the impact of airway compliance. This knowledge is crucial for improving cuff management strategies and preventing complications due to the narrow volume range between adequate sealing and overinflation.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated the P-V behavior of  ETT cuffs across three airway models:
•	Rigid manikin airway (Ambu™) simulating a noncompliant trachea
•	Elastic airway trainer (TruCorp™) representing compliant, tissue-like expansion
•	Cadaveric human tracheas (freshly frozen without fixatives) representing true human airway compliance
Two common adult ETT cuff types were tested in each model:
•	TaperGuard™ (Covidien) - a tapered high-volume, low-pressure cuff
•	Sheridan™ Reinforced (Teleflex) - a cylindrical high-volume, low-pressure cuff
Each tube was tested with internal diameters ranging from 6.0 to 8.0 mm. Cuffs were incrementally inflated using a Luer-lock syringe (max volume 10mL) in 0.2 mL steps, with intracuff pressure recorded after each injection using a calibrated cuff manometer. Inflation continued until 120 cmH₂O was reached. Each tube-model combination was tested in triplicate. Third-order polynomial models were fitted to the P-V data using least-squares regression: 
P(V) = a + bV + cV2 + dV3
If the cubic coefficient (d) was not statistically significant (p>0.05), the model was reduced to a second order (quadratic) polynomial:
P(V) =  a  + bV  + cV2.
Additionally, power-law relationships of the form:
P(V)=αVβ
were compared by log-transforming both variables and applying linear regression:
ln(P)=ln(α)+βln(V).
Model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and the standard error of the estimate (SEE). Pressure escalation slopes from 20 to 30 cmH₂O (i.e., ΔP/ΔV) were calculated, and inter-model differences in these slopes were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey posthoc comparisons. Paired t-tests were employed to compare residuals (polynomial vs. power-law) in the high-pressure region (V≥3.0 mL). All statistical tests were conducted in SPSS v28, with significance defined as p<0.05.
This study did not involve live human or animal subjects. Ethical considerations for cadaver use followed the relevant institutional guidelines (CORID #1091).

Results 
Nonlinear Pressure-Volume Behavior Across Models
All three airway models, rigid manikin, elastic trainer, and cadaveric trachea, demonstrated nonlinear pressure-volume (P-V) behavior across cuff types and sizes. Cuff pressure remained low in early inflation phases but escalated sharply beyond a specific threshold volume. Third-order polynomial models consistently produced a superior fit for this behavior, particularly in the high-pressure range (R² ≥ 0.93-0.99), outperforming power-law models, which underestimated pressures by 5-15 cmH₂O when inflation exceeded 3.0-3.5 mL.
Rigid Model
In the rigid manikin model, pressure escalation occurred at inflation volumes of 2.0-2.5 mL across both TaperGuard and Sheridan cuffs. Polynomial fits achieved R² values of 0.98-0.99 with standard errors of estimate (SEE) <2.0 cmH₂O. For instance, a representative TaperGuard 6.0 cuff fit was:
P(V)=3.50−15.33V+25.32V2−3.25V3(R2=0.98, SEE=1.87 cmH2O)
whereas the power-law approximation (ln(P)=16.18+1.42ln(V)) began to underestimate pressures by several cmH₂O at volumes greater than 3.0 mL, seen in Table 1. The volume increment (ΔV) required to transition from 20 cmH₂O to 30 cmH₂O ranged widely (0.22-0.70 mL), showing how quickly hazards of overinflation can develop in a noncompliant airway setting. Power-law approximations became increasingly inaccurate beyond 3.0 mL, underestimating pressure by 3-5 cmH₂O.
Elastic Trucorp Model
In the Trucorp elastic model, greater airway compliance allowed delayed pressure inflection. Compared to the rigid model, the inflation volume needed to reach 20 cmH₂O was 15-30% higher. However, once that threshold was surpassed, pressure still rose steeply into the 30 cmH₂O range within 0.3-0.4 mL. A representative polynomial fit (Sheridan 7.0 cuff) showed:
P(V)=−0.13+5.08V−2.24V2+0.41V3(R2=0.98, SEE=0.45 cmH2O).
while power-law functions (P=3.18V1.19) systematically under-predicted the final high-pressure phase by 5-10 cmH₂O if volumes exceeded roughly 4.5 mL (Table 2). Mean ΔV from 20 to 30 cmH₂O for both cuff types was 0.40 mL.
Cadaver Tissue
The cadaver trachea exhibited the earliest and steepest pressure escalation. Inflation volumes of just 2.5-3.0 mL resulted in pressures exceeding 20 cmH₂O, with only 0.2-0.3 mL additional air required to reach 30 cmH₂O. This ΔV was 50% smaller than in synthetic models (p < 0.01), indicating a significantly narrower "safe" inflation margin. For a TaperGuard 6.0 cuff:
P(V)=−0.64+25.45V+14.66V2−2.77V3(R2=0.997, SEE=0.17 cmH2O)
In contrast, a power-law approximation (P=e34.39V1.48) reproduced only the initial, lower-pressure range and erred by as much as 10-15 cmH₂O when volumes approached the 3.0-3.5 mL region, example in Table 3. Pressure escalation slopes in cadaveric tissue were 15-18% steeper than synthetic models (p < 0.01), suggesting heightened risk for mucosal injury in less compliant human tissue.
Cuff Design and Size Effects
Cross-model analysis for 7.0 mm cuffs demonstrated the following ΔV (20→30 cmH₂O):
•	Rigid model: 0.46 mL (TaperGuard), 0.50 mL (Sheridan)
•	Elastic model: 0.40 mL (both cuffs)
•	Cadaver model: 0.25 mL (TaperGuard), 0.30 mL (Sheridan)
Escalation slopes (cmH₂O/mL) were sharpest in cadaveric tissue: 40.0 (TaperGuard) vs. 33.3 (Sheridan), compared to 20-25 in synthetic models, summarized in the cross-model comparison (Table 4). Notably, the cadaver model had significantly smaller standard errors of estimate and showed a marked inflection in P-V curves within narrow volume thresholds.
TaperGuard cuffs required slightly lower volumes to achieve 20-30 cmH₂O compared to Sheridan cuffs, particularly in smaller tube sizes. At lower pressures, cuff geometry influenced inflation behavior: TaperGuard curves had smaller quadratic/cubic terms, indicating flatter slopes in early inflation phases. However, once pressure exceeded ~25 cmH₂O, both cuffs showed converging escalation behavior. Figures 3 and 4 show cross model comparisons of 6.0 and 8.0 size tubes.
Tube size influenced the absolute volume required to seal: 8.0 mm tubes needed 0.3-0.5 mL more than 6.0 mm tubes to reach 20 cmH₂O. However, this effect diminished at higher pressures, with similar ΔV and slope characteristics beyond 25 cmH₂O across sizes (p > 0.10). Among all sizes and models, the narrowest ΔV occurred in cadaveric models, independent of tube diameter. Full dataset-level fits and regression coefficients are provided in Supplementary Table 5. 

Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that ETT cuff pressure-volume dynamics can vary dramatically depending on both the cuff design and the compliance of the surrounding tracheal environment. In the cadaveric trachea model, which most closely approximates the human airway, we observed a particularly steep pressure rise as the cuff approached its sealing volume. Notably, an increase of just ~0.25 mL of air near the sealing point caused cuff pressure to climb sharply into the high-pressure range. This underscores how limited the “safe zone” of inflation can be in a realistic airway: once the cuff fills the available tracheal space, even a tiny additional volume can send pressures past 30 cmH₂O. 
Our study demonstrates low-pressure plateau followed by high pressure spikes in all scenarios. This dual behavior is expected as it aligns with balloon mechanics where the uninflated, or underinflated cuff is easy to inflate when it is not constrained, however when it pushes against the solid boundary (the trachea), it requires increasingly high pressures to inflate. This transition occurred around 25-30 cmH₂O, suggesting that the cuff pressure safety range of 30 cmH₂O is not just related to tissue ischemia, but the mechanical tipping point where the trachea experiences a disproportionate increate in force for each added volume.  This finding is consistent with prior observations that ETT cuffs are highly sensitive to small volume increments, particularly in stiffer or smaller airway conduits, leading to disproportionately large pressure changes above our mechanical tipping point15,16. This underscores the importance of measuring cuff pressure whenever feasible, rather than relying solely on pilot‐balloon palpation or default inflation volumes3,19. In contrast, the elastic trachea model (with greater wall compliance) allowed a slightly larger volume window before a similarly dramatic pressure escalation occurred, whereas the rigid tube model (with no ability to expand) tended to reach high pressures abruptly as soon as the cuff contacted the wall. The key insight is that tracheal compliance significantly influences the pressure-volume (P-V) curve: less compliant airways yield much steeper P-V slopes and thus require especially careful inflation to avoid overshooting safe pressures.
Cuff design also played a pivotal role in cuff performance. Tapered cuffs achieved an effective seal at lower inflation volumes compared to conventional cylindrical cuffs, reaching the target safe pressure (~20-25 cmH₂O) with less air. Clinically, this suggests that tapered high-volume cuffs conform to the tracheal wall more efficiently, needing less inflation to obturate the airway. Such behavior can be beneficial in that it reduces the initial volume (and pressure) required for an adequate seal, potentially lowering the risk of unnecessary overinflation. Our results are consistent with prior reports that tapered cuff tubes can form a seal at lower cuff pressures than cylindrical designs.20 However, “less volume to seal” does not eliminate the risk of injury from overinflation, it simply shifts the pressure-volume curve. In our tests, if a tapered cuff was inflated beyond the minimal sealing volume, its pressure still rose quickly and could exceed safe thresholds, though the critical volume at which this occurred was smaller. This finding reinforces that regardless of cuff shape and varying cuff size, even when the internal tube diameter is identical, vigilant monitoring of cuff pressure is required rather than relying solely on pilot‐balloon palpation or default inflation volumes32129. A tapered cuff may provide a modest safety buffer; for example, a better seal at lower baseline pressure and smaller pressure changes with certain external stresses, but our results confirm that it too can generate excessive pressures if overinflated or if the tracheal wall cannot accommodate further expansion20,27,28. 
Another notable aspect of this study is the mathematical characterization of the cuff’s pressure-volume behavior. We found that a third-order polynomial function provided a superior fit for the high-pressure segment of the P-V curve compared to a simple power-law model. In practical terms, this means the relationship between added volume and resulting pressure is not a fixed exponential ratio but rather has a more complex curvature, particularly as the cuff becomes tightly constrained by the tracheal wall. The polynomial model captured the abrupt upswing in pressure that occurs as the cuff approaches the limits of the tracheal space, whereas the power-law model tended to underestimate these late-phase pressure surges. This insight supports the concept that cuff inflation dynamics involve multiple phases - an initial compliant phase followed by a sharply rising phase once the cuff and trachea walls are in close apposition. It also explains why small volume increments can be benign early in inflation but hazardous later on.22 Standard in vitro testing or modeling that assumes a simple volume-pressure relationship may fail to predict these dangerous spikes, underscoring the need for cautious, stepwise inflation and continuous pressure monitoring in practice23. By appreciating the nonlinear and compliance-dependent nature of ETT cuff dynamics demonstrated in this study, practitioners and researchers can better tailor cuff inflation practices to maintain airway security while minimizing the risk of mucosal damage.
From a clinical perspective, our results underline several important points for airway management. Pressures exceeding 30 cmH₂O can rapidly compromise tracheal mucosal blood flow and have been linked to tissue damage when sustained4. Our data illustrate how easily such high pressures may be reached if cuff volume is not carefully titrated, reinforcing the importance of using the minimum effective cuff volume (or pressure) to achieve a seal and of keeping cuff pressures below ~30 cmH₂O21. Across the three airway models, rigid, elastic, and cadaveric, the margin between a “safe” 20 cmH₂O and 30 cmH₂O could be as small as 0.2-0.3 mL of added air. Because syringes or manual estimates often exceed such small increments, there is a real risk of inadvertently applying unsafe pressures17,24.  In practice, this means routine use of cuff pressure manometers and adherence to minimal occlusive volume techniques, since “just a bit more air” in an already inflated cuff can inadvertently cause a dramatic pressure rise. Additionally, the pronounced influence of tracheal compliance suggests that individual patient factors (such as tracheal stiffness or external compression by neck surgical retractors) will significantly affect cuff pressures. An inflation that results in 20 cmH₂O in one patient might produce far higher pressure in another with a stiffer airway or narrower tracheal diameter, even for the same added volume of air13. Bench tests using rigid airway models likely underestimate these patient-specific differences, so clinicians should be especially vigilant and consider continuous pressure monitoring in situations of reduced or altered airway compliance, even if initial cuff pressures appear acceptable14,23,25. Moreover, simulation-based airway models, while useful for training, often lack the fidelity to predict real-world pressure-volume dynamics, particularly in edge cases23,25,26.
There are limitations to this study. First, though the cadaveric trachea more closely approximates actual tissue anatomy and stiffness than do synthetic models, it cannot replicate living physiology such as mucosal blood flow or reactive edema30. Second, we did not track changes in cuff pressure or tracheal compliance over time. Gradual tracheal dilation in cadavers or evolving edema in living tissue could alter compliance, but these dynamics were not captured here.  Third, we did not evaluate long‐term effects of sustained cuff pressures on tissue integrity; future studies could investigate extended inflation and perfusion in ex vivo or in vivo designs. Despite these limitations, the trends observed provide valuable guidance for clinicians about how cuff design and patient anatomy interact. Additional research might focus on real‐time cuff monitoring during patient maneuvers, e.g., head rotation, sedation changes, or mechanical ventilation adjustments, that can inadvertently shift cuff volumes. Investigations into next‐generation cuffs (e.g., advanced materials or tapered shapes) may also clarify whether they mitigate the steep pressure jumps reported here, ultimately guiding safer design or recommended inflation strategies12.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that ETT cuff pressure-volume behavior is highly sensitive to both airway compliance and cuff design. In the cadaveric trachea, where compliance is lowest, cuff pressure escalated sharply with as little as 0.25 mL of added volume, leaving a narrow margin between sealing and overinflation. Tapered cuffs reached safe pressures with lower volumes than cylindrical cuffs, but all designs exhibited steep pressure increases beyond the sealing point. Polynomial models best captured these nonlinear dynamics. Clinically, these findings emphasize the importance of cuff pressure monitoring and caution against using fixed inflation volumes. Safe airway management requires an appreciation of how small volume adjustments can disproportionately affect cuff pressure, especially in less compliant airways.
